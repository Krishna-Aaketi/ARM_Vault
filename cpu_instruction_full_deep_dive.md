# üß† Deep Dive: CPU Instruction Structure

---

## üîß What is a CPU Instruction?

A **CPU instruction** is a single command given to the processor. It's like a line of code in the CPU's native language, telling it to:

- Do a calculation (e.g., `ADD`, `SUB`)
- Move data (e.g., `MOV`, `LOAD`, `STORE`)
- Make a decision (e.g., `JUMP`, `CALL`, `RETURN`)

It‚Äôs part of the **instruction set** defined by the CPU‚Äôs architecture (like ARM, MIPS, x86, etc.).

## üß± Structure of an Instruction (Simplified)

Every instruction generally has 3 key parts:

| Part          | Role                                 | Example from `ADD R1, R2, R3`  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Opcode**    | Operation to perform (like a verb)   | `ADD` ‚Üí tells CPU to add       |
| **Operands**  | Input data (registers or memory)     | `R2`, `R3` ‚Üí values to be added|
| **Destination**| Where to store the result (register)| `R1` ‚Üí holds the result        |

---

## üî∑ 1. Opcode ‚Äì What to do

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
The **action or instruction type**.  
Tells the CPU what operation to perform (e.g., add, move, load, store).

### üß† Think of it like:
> A verb in a sentence ‚Üí it defines the **action**.

### üí¨ Example:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```

This means `ADD` is the **opcode**.

### üî© Common Opcodes:

| Opcode | Meaning         |
|--------|------------------|
| ADD    | Add values       |
| SUB    | Subtract         |
| MOV    | Move/copy data   |
| LDR    | Load from memory |
| STR    | Store into memory|

---

## üî∑ 2. Operands ‚Äì What to operate on

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
These are the **inputs** or **data sources**, usually **registers** or **memory locations**.

### üß† Think of it like:
> Nouns in a sentence ‚Üí the things being acted upon.

### üí¨ Example:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```
Operands are `R2` and `R3`.

### üîé Operand Types:

| Type        | Example   | Description                        |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| Register    | R2, R3    | Fast storage inside CPU            |
| Immediate   | #5        | Constant number                    |
| Memory      | [R0]      | Data from memory address in R0     |

---

## üî∑ 3. Destination ‚Äì Where to store result

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
This tells the CPU **where to save the output** of the operation, often a **register**.

### üß† Think of it like:
> The **target or result** of the action.

### üí¨ Example:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```

Destination is `R1`.

‚úÖ This means: `R1 = R2 + R3`

## üßæ Putting It All Together

| Instruction        | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ADD R1, R2, R3     | R1 = R2 + R3                                     |
| SUB R4, R4, #1     | R4 = R4 - 1                                      |
| MOV R0, #5         | Move value 5 into register R0                   |
| STR R1, [R2]       | Store R1‚Äôs value into memory at address in R2    |
| LDR R1, [R2]       | Load from memory at address in R2 into R1        |

## üß† Summary Table

| Part        | What it Does                     | Example in `ADD R1, R2, R3` |
|-------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Opcode**  | Operation type                   | ADD                          |
| **Operands**| Input values                     | R2, R3                       |
| **Destination** | Output/result register         | R1                           |

## üß† Why This Matters

| Role             | Impact                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Opcode**        | Decides the CPU operation                   |
| **Operands**      | Provides input data                         |
| **Destination**   | Sets where the result goes                  |
| **Clear Structure**| Allows efficient pipeline design           |
