---

## üîß What is a CPU Instruction?

A **CPU instruction** is a single command given to the processor. It's like a line of code in the CPU's native language, telling it to:

- Do a calculation (e.g., `ADD`, `SUB`)
- Move data (e.g., `MOV`, `LOAD`, `STORE`)
- Make a decision (e.g., `JUMP`, `CALL`, `RETURN`)

It‚Äôs part of the **instruction set** defined by the CPU‚Äôs architecture (like ARM, MIPS, x86, etc.).

---

## üß± Structure of an Instruction (Simplified)

Every instruction generally has 3 key parts:

| Part          | Role                                 | Example from `ADD R1, R2, R3`  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Opcode**    | Operation to perform (like a verb)   | `ADD` ‚Üí tells CPU to add       |
| **Operands**  | Input data (registers or memory)     | `R2`, `R3` ‚Üí values to be added|
| **Destination**| Where to store the result (register)| `R1` ‚Üí holds the result        |

---

## üî∑ 1. Opcode ‚Äì What to do

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
The **action or instruction type**.  
Tells the CPU what operation to perform (e.g., add, move, load, store).

### üß† Think of it like:
> A verb in a sentence ‚Üí it defines the **action**.

### üí¨ Example:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```

This means `ADD` is the **opcode**.

### üî© Common Opcodes:

| Opcode | Meaning         |
|--------|------------------|
| ADD    | Add values       |
| SUB    | Subtract         |
| MOV    | Move/copy data   |
| LDR    | Load from memory |
| STR    | Store into memory|

---

## üî∑ 2. Operands ‚Äì What to operate on

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
These are the **inputs** or **data sources**, usually **registers** or **memory locations**.

### üß† Think of it like:
> Nouns in a sentence ‚Üí the things being acted upon.

### üí¨ Example:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```
Operands are `R2` and `R3`.

### üîé Operand Types:

| Type        | Example   | Description                        |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------|
| Register    | R2, R3    | Fast storage inside CPU            |
| Immediate   | #5        | Constant number                    |
| Memory      | [R0]      | Data from memory address in R0     |

---

## üî∑ 3. Destination ‚Äì Where to store result

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
This tells the CPU **where to save the output** of the operation, often a **register**.

### üß† Think of it like:
> The **target or result** of the action.

### üí¨ Example:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```

Destination is `R1`.

‚úÖ This means: `R1 = R2 + R3`

---

## üßæ Putting It All Together

| Instruction        | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ADD R1, R2, R3     | R1 = R2 + R3                                     |
| SUB R4, R4, #1     | R4 = R4 - 1                                      |
| MOV R0, #5         | Move value 5 into register R0                   |
| STR R1, [R2]       | Store R1‚Äôs value into memory at address in R2    |
| LDR R1, [R2]       | Load from memory at address in R2 into R1        |

---

## üß† Summary Table

| Part        | What it Does                     | Example in `ADD R1, R2, R3` |

# üìò What is an Instruction Set?

---

## ‚úÖ Definition: Instruction Set

An **Instruction Set** (also called **Instruction Set Architecture** or ISA) is the **complete set of instructions** a CPU can understand and execute.

It tells the CPU **how to perform basic operations** like:

- Do a calculation (e.g., `ADD`, `SUB`)
- Move data (e.g., `MOV`, `LDR`, `STR`)
- Make a decision (e.g., `JMP`, `BEQ`, `BNE`)
- Control program flow and system behavior (e.g., `CALL`, `RET`, `NOP`)

üß† Think of the Instruction Set as the **CPU's language**. Different CPU architectures (like ARM, x86, MIPS) have **different instruction sets**.

---

## üß± Structure of an Instruction Set

An instruction set includes **many types of instructions**, grouped by function.

| Type of Instruction | Purpose                             | Examples                       |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Arithmetic           | Perform math operations             | `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`     |
| Data Movement        | Move/copy data                      | `MOV`, `LDR`, `STR`            |
| Logical Operations   | Bitwise logic                       | `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`      |
| Control Flow         | Branching and jumping               | `JMP`, `CALL`, `RET`, `BNE`    |
| Comparison           | Compare values                      | `CMP`, `TST`                   |
| System               | Special CPU-level instructions      | `SVC`, `INT`, `NOP`            |

---

## üî∑ Example: Arithmetic Instruction in ARM

### ‚úÖ Instruction:
```asm
ADD R1, R2, R3
```

### ‚úÖ Meaning:
Add the values in `R2` and `R3`, and store the result in `R1`.

### üîç Breakdown:
| Part        | Value  | Meaning                          |
|-------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| Opcode      | `ADD`  | Add operation                    |
| Operand 1   | `R2`   | First input                      |
| Operand 2   | `R3`   | Second input                     |
| Destination | `R1`   | Result is stored here            |

‚úÖ Final result: `R1 = R2 + R3`
