# DAY 1: What is ARM Architecture? (Introduction + History + Basics)

## 🎯 Goal of Day 1

Understand:

- What ARM is  
- Why ARM is used  
- Where ARM is used  
- Difference between ARM vs others  
- History & evolution  

---

## 🧠 Step 1: What is a CPU Architecture?

**CPU architecture** = design or blueprint of how a processor works.

It defines:

- How instructions are executed  
- How data is stored/moved  
- How the control unit and ALU operate  

**Examples**: x86, MIPS, RISC-V, ARM

---

## 🔍 Step 2: What is ARM?

- **ARM** stands for **Advanced RISC Machine**  
- It is a **RISC-based processor architecture**  
- Created by a UK company named **ARM Holdings**  
- **ARM Holdings licenses** the design, doesn't manufacture chips  

**Examples of users**: Apple, Samsung, Qualcomm all use ARM cores.

## 📏 Step 3: What is RISC?

| Feature     | RISC (like ARM)        | CISC (like x86)         |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Instructions| Few & simple           | Many & complex           |
| Speed       | Fast                   | Slower                   |
| Power       | Low power              | High power               |
| Usage       | Mobile, IoT, embedded  | Laptops, desktops        |

## 🧩 Step 7: ARM Naming Confusion Simplified

| Name Type     | Meaning                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| ARM7, ARM9    | Old families (legacy)                    |
| Cortex-M      | For Microcontrollers (STM32, LPC)        |
| Cortex-R      | For Real-time systems (automotive)       |
| Cortex-A      | For Application Processors (phones)      |
| Neoverse      | For Servers/Data Centers                 |

## ⭐ Step 8: Why is ARM so Popular?

- Low power usage  
- High performance per watt  
- Licensable → others can customize (e.g. Apple M1)  
- Small size → fits in embedded devices  
- Growing ecosystem (STM32, Raspberry Pi, Android)
